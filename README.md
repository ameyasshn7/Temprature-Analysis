# IoT Temperature Analysis

## Overview
This GitHub repository hosts an Internet of Things (IoT) project focused on temperature data analysis and visualization. It serves as a valuable component of my IoT project, where I designed a system to detect potential threats, such as fires, within a house. This analysis demonstrates how the system can identify abnormal rises in temperatures within the house environment.

### Project Highlights
- **Objective:** This project aims to analyze and visualize temperature data collected from IoT sensors within a house to identify potential threats, such as fires.
- **Key Features:**
  - Data loading and preprocessing.
  - Hourly, daily, and monthly temperature data resampling.
  - Interactive temperature visualization using Plotly.
  - Data insights and analysis, including temperature comparisons to detect abnormalities.

### Code Examples
Here are some key code snippets from the project:

- **Data Preprocessing:** The project includes code to load and preprocess temperature data from a CSV file.

- **Data Visualization:** It provides interactive visualizations comparing hourly and monthly temperature data, showcasing how temperature anomalies can be detected.

- **Data Analysis:** The code also includes insights into temperature data, highlighting abnormal temperature rises within the house.

### Getting Started
To run this project locally or reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Upload your temperature data in CSV format as "IOT-temp.csv."
4. Run the provided Python scripts to analyze and visualize the data.

### Technologies Used
